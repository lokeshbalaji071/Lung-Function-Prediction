# Lung-Function-Prediction
•	Developed a Machine learning model to predict the patient’s lung function capacity based on various health factors

•	Performed exploratory Data Analysis and Incorporated various regression models such as like XGB, SGD, Bayesian Ridge, LassoLars, ARD, Passive Aggressive and Thielsen algorithm and also trained the model with Deep Neural Network

•	Plotted the RMS values of DNN epochs using Pyplot and determined the dataset consists of  Linearly separable data points and achieved Root Mean Squared Error of 1.02
